## Why

The roadmap currently includes internal version ranges (e.g. `v0.7 - v0.9`) that can be misleading. Also, Milestone 5 calls out production documentation (troubleshooting) which is not yet present.

## What Changes

- Update `docs/roadmap.md` to remove misleading internal version numbers/ranges and keep milestones version-agnostic.
- Add `docs/troubleshooting.md` covering common build/load/import failures and recommended fixes.
- Link troubleshooting docs from `README.md`.
