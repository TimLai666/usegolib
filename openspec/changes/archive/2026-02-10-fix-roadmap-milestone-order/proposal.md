## Why

`docs/roadmap.md` currently lists Milestone 6 before Milestone 5, which is confusing and looks like a sequencing decision. We should reorder milestones so numbering is increasing and clarify how post-v1.0 feature expansion fits into the roadmap.

## What Changes

- Reorder `docs/roadmap.md` so Milestone 5 appears before Milestone 6.
- Add a short note clarifying that Milestone 6 (methods/generics) is planned after v1.0 readiness work unless explicitly prioritized earlier.
