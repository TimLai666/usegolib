## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Roadmap Milestone Ordering Is Consistent
The repository SHALL keep `docs/roadmap.md` milestones ordered by increasing milestone number to avoid confusion about sequencing.

#### Scenario: Milestones are ordered
- **WHEN** a developer reads `docs/roadmap.md`
- **THEN** Milestone sections appear in increasing numerical order (e.g. 4, 5, 6)
