# Design: Roadmap Extension For Methods + Generics

This change is documentation-only, clarifying:
- current behavior: methods/generics are ignored by the scanner (v0.x)
- planned future milestones and likely approach

Implementation of method/generic support is out-of-scope for this change; only the roadmap is updated.
